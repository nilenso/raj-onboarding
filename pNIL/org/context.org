#+title: Context

* Aspects
** Generic
*** FaaS (Function as a Service)
   - allows users to run code without having to manage the required platform for the same 
   - the code, in this context, has to confirm to a certain signature (be compliant with an interface), for instance: =function(input: string)  -> output : string=
*** Sandboxing   
   - isolated execution of a job/process so as to shield parent/sibling processes from unexpected/malicious behaviours
** Project Specific
 - WASM (Web Assembly) 
   - the common transpilation target for different languages that users will be able to register functions for 
* User Stories
** register a function
 Users need to be able to register a func, in order to execute a function
*** acceptance
**** functional requirements
 - [ ] validation (tiered)
   - [ ] source language not implemented
   - [ ] source does not conform to spec
 - [ ] auth
 - [ ] compilation
 - [ ] wasm binary registration
**** non-functional requirements
   - [ ] observability
** execute a function
** list executions
