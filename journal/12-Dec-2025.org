** Project Management Setup

- Consumed [[https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/09/17/the-common-sense-unit-of-work/][The Common Sense Unit of Work]] blog
- Created [[file:../projectNIL/project-management.md][project-management.md]] with:
  - INVEST criteria for units of work
  - GitHub labels (status, priority)
  - Kanban workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done)
  - gh CLI commands for issue management

- Set up GitHub infrastructure:
  - Labels: ~status: blocked~, ~status: needs-refinement~, ~priority: high/medium/low~
  - Project board: https://github.com/orgs/nilenso/projects/24

** Branching Strategy Update

- Updated [[file:../projectNIL/AGENTS.md][AGENTS.md]] with refined branching model:
  | Branch             | Purpose                | CI | CD | Merge to Main          |
  |--------------------+------------------------+----+----+------------------------|
  | ~main~             | Production             | ✅ | ✅ | -                      |
  | ~dev~              | Technical tasks        | ✅ | ❌ | PR required, squash    |
  | ~journal~          | Documentation          | ❌ | ❌ | Daily squash, no PR    |
  | ~feature-issue-<N>~ | Feature work          | ✅ | ❌ | PR required, squash    |

- Updated [[file:../.github/workflows/ci-dev.yml][ci-dev.yml]] to trigger on ~feature-issue-*~ branches

** Domain Modelling (Issue #19)

  - Access control logic (embedded permissions)
  - User stories by phase
  - Phase definitions (0: no auth, 1: auth, 2: analytics)

- Created [[file:../projectNIL/docs/toThink.md][docs/toThink.md]] for open questions:
  - Function body storage (spike needed)
  - Execution table growth
  - Function versioning

- Added [[file:../projectNIL/AGENTS.md][domain policy]] in AGENTS.md: user drives domain work, agent reviews
