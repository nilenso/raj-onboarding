* Misc
 - dev env ready
   - doom emacs-plus@30 (native comp) for knowledge base, GTD with captures, journalling, LLM interface and generic interop
   - Tmux, vi for quick edits
   - intellij for java 
 - github repository for onboarding live 
* Java
 - starting out with Effective Java
   - objective is to pick up the mindset the language encourages and have a pedagogical CRUD built by the end of the following week
 - supplementing with basic blogs to get up to speed on the syntax : admittedly (shamefully), haven't done java before
 - post that : getting into Java: concurrency in practice
 - started writing some basic programs in emacs (will be using intellij for actual work when the learning phase is over cause neena(and a lot of people on the internet) says(say) that emacs is not it when it comes to java)
* flowing thoughts on first project
 - thought of creating a CLI slack client that would allow you to interact with messages, threads and channels in bulk with a DSL
   - the underlying data format would be json so seemed like an opportunity for some quick filters, maps and accumulates that could be employed
   - what about a summary of a thread for someone
   - what about context engineering for a particular slack thread surrounding some queries
   - could build a vector index for the thread
   - too big for an initial project as of now
 - feedback received that should consider iterating quickly instead
 - need to ideate more
 - what about a slack bot that writes in italics as to what the person is upto with a certain flavour that can be tuned
