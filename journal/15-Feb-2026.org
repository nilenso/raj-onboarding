 - updates from yesterday
 - taking in cli args instead of passing a fixed config now
 - readup on the atoms, refs, vars and agents
   - using atoms for state management (conn pool of db and config)
 - getting comfortable with tdd w/ cider
   - and the repl driven mindset, haven't restarted my nrepl server for a while now : slowly getting what it actually means rather
 - wrote the get-function-by-id like that 
 - proceeding with the usual tdd (red, green, refactor) for the rest of the check boxes in the issue (gh issue view 75)
   - commit would consequently follow that pattern for a while : red, green, refactor prefixes
 - fixed some nrepl-middleware deps
* 2026-02-15
 - read about diff b/w clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo and java.lang.Exception
 - writing some error and test helpers
 - refactoring for uniformity all across

* 2026-02-15 14:25:29  
 - tdd for update-function : done
 - jumping into sources more often (jdbc/update! and other syntactic sugars)
 - getting better with repl usage
