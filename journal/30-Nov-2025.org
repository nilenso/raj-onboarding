* Java
 - JUnit, gradle (not doing maven as of now) with DSL as groovy
 - on my way to getting into spring
 - gradle CLI + emacs scaffolds rather than intellij
 - TDD with the inbuilt test class, etc ...
 - can write basic programs myself with old ways I know 
 - now can begin understanding the Java way : effective Java is a good bed time read btw
* Misc
 - first thought I should name my first project : project 1
 - then recalled we're SWEs (& I hate lua (nvim < emacs)) and should be project 0
 - then recalled I like lisp and should be project nil 
 - repo init (java application + library) : the gradle-init.sh documents the configs used for init
* Project NIL
 - read misc first

 - want this to help me get to know the tooling rather than actually solve a problem

 - proceeding with a sentinel problem :
   - a basic calculator with a core (operand & operator orchestrator)parser/router/aggregator, and a microservice for each of addition , multiplication, subtraction and division

   - scope creep init:
     - basic parser
     - the ops
     - custom exceptions
     - caching
     - structured logging
     - scheduler down the line with potential for concurrency experiments
     - ...
       
   - will also introduce probabilistic delays in the manner of pre and post hooks in places so that I could test out the benchmarking and profiling ecosystem for the language

   - sounds good as of now : I will be able to refactor iteratively with the concepts that I learn 

   - good opportunity to build the most over-engineered calculator out there

   - will start documenting the tech stack explored in a different subtree henceforth : as of today : getting into spring boot and plan on building that basic scaffold for P-'() with containerized setup for integration and e2e tests
