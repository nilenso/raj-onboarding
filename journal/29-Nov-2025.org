* Project 0
 - have been thinking about this lately :
   - need a database and a web component to get used to the usuals
 - Neo4j and DeepLearning4j seem enticing to get into
 - have already been looking into ontologies for a while : might as well consider building something minimal and neurosymbolic : what about a KG augmented chatbot trained on some basic nilenso's corpus 
 - starting out from parsing corpus to building the graph to finally enabling RAG upon it
 - again trying not to think to far into the future but I'm just going to iterate this time : might not be a product by the end of it : but atleast have an iterative vision for this
 - a CLI interface at the minimal sounds feasible in a short duration
 - might as well get into jvm internals while I'm at it
 - I guess, moving into clojure later on would help me build DSLs efficiently as well ( in an industry context )
 - posting links
   - https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/machine-learning/
   - https://neo4j.com/books/developers-guide-how-to-build-knowledge-graph/
   - https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/
   - https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15917v2
 - anyway, not going to think too big right away and going to get started with smaller iterations and potential integrations
** iteration 0
 - the first aspect of such a pipeline would be able to consume a corpus and generate a knowledge graph from it
 - so far liking this train of thought so am going to explore
* Java
 - effective java as usual
 - accelerated consumption compared to the past few days as expected
 - emacs seems to be fine : lsp, dape, and the inbuilt quick testing triggers for TDD help out with quick iterations compared to compiling and checking output
 - ecosystem wise : getting into JUnit, JBehave and Spring boot
* Misc
 - finally efficient with my dev setup : feels like home again
 - some rough edges exist (the occassional touching the touch pad) but feeling better than expected
