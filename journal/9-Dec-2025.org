### Agentic Tooling Disclaimer

 - LLMs were explicitly employed (write access) for some portions of the project: 
   - Documentation
     - diagramming DSLs (mermaid/plantuml)
     - minor documentation commentary over code when necessary 
     - commit messages (conventional commits style) : tag lines and descriptions
   - CI/CD setup
   
 - Apart from the above, they were granted read-only access to the repository to help me discuss the domain-oriented aspects (SWE Wisdom, writing effective Java, Design, Architecture) I wish to improve my grasp of: the source code (other than deterministically auto-generated (`gradle init` for instance) files) is hand-crafted and have marked any exceptions (if any) in [LLM generated]  fences.
