* PNil
 - pivoting into building a function as a service (FaaS)
 - had some time to chart out the abstractions I'm going to deal with in the flight : couldn't use my laptop cause I was seated next to the emergency exit (wasn't aware this was a thing): so had to pull out the pocket notebook
 - Jobs, Users, Operator, Environment
 - So thinking simply : fine grained tokens allow protected CRUDS over these entities/ aggregations there of ...
 - DB Schema design and class modelling init
 - System Design simple initially : MVP first then figure out bottlenecks ..
* Java
 - effective java and dev.java as usual for a while 
* Deadlines
