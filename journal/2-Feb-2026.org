* pNIL WorkLog
** [X] setup clj-kondo with bb
** [ ] separate production and testing db for pnil
   - involves creating a podman compose alias in bb with a different db name (projectnil-test), prod remains projectnil
** [ ] setup clojure.test usage
   - get tests running for pg reads and writes
     - uses the test db setup above and not the local prod(dev)
** [ ] old compiler setup bb cmd
 - runs the java compiler (web assmebly script) for testing the new clojure 
** [ ] user story write for executions endpoint
 - exec a func -> create on an exec : setup sentinel for now (triggers chicory runtime exec (sync))
 - read an exec(s) 
** [ ] chicory implementation in clojure : spike
 - be able to run a wasm bin in clojure (the api) : new user story
 - dependent on the executions endpoint being implemented for user acceptance criteria observability

** [ ] research non functional benchmarking potential
 - initial discussion with neena
