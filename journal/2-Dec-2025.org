 - initial chat with Udit and Govind today : will pair up with them soon
   - initially for design reviews, soon for code reviews

 - work wise: three things as of now:
   - learning java & ecosystem (dev.java, gradle, spring)   
   - learning how to write java (effective java)
   - project-nil (design, early documentation, scaffolds and refining scope)

 - before I proceed with coding for p-nil, setting up CI & D on github (digital ocean for deployment)
