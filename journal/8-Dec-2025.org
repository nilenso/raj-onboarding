#+title: 8 Dec 2025

* Branching Strategy & Workflow Documentation
  - defined and documented three-branch model: main, dev, journal
    - main: production branch with full CI/CD (GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages)
    - dev: development branch with CI only (build, check, test)
    - journal: personal logs with no CI (all commits require [skip ci] tag)
  - updated README.md and AGENTS.md with branching guidelines
  - ensured [skip ci] requirement is clear for journal commits to prevent unnecessary CI triggers
  - merged journal documentation into main via main

* GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup
  - created ci-dev.yml: CI pipeline for dev branch
    - runs: build → check (checkstyle, spotbugs) → test
    - uploads test results and generates JUnit reports
    - 30-day artifact retention
  - created ci-cd-main.yml: full CI/CD pipeline for main branch
    - runs: build → check → test → generate coverage (JaCoCo) & javadoc
    - deploys docs and coverage reports to GitHub Pages (separate gh-pages branch)
    - creates index.html for navigation between docs and coverage
    - DigitalOcean deployment placeholder with loud TODO warning (ready for future config)
    - fails deployment if tests fail or javadoc generation errors
  - configured JaCoCo for code coverage reporting in build.gradle
    - generates HTML and XML coverage reports
    - test task finalized by coverage report generation
  - set javadoc.failOnError = true to fail build on javadoc errors
  - added CI/CD status badges to readme.md (dev and main workflows)

* GitHub CLI Setup
  - installed gh via Homebrew
  - authenticated with OAuth via browser (logged in as rajp152k)
  - created PR #1 from dev to main via command line
  - merged PR #1 to main (243 additions, 8 deletions)

* Updated Documentation
  - updated progress.org with completed CI/CD setup checklist
  - marked CI setup as DONE [1/2] with detailed sub-items
  - added Workflow & Branching Strategy section as DONE
  - DigitalOcean CD still pending with placeholder in workflow

* Next Steps
  - configure GitHub Pages in repository settings (Settings → Pages)
  - configure branch protection rules for main (require CI status checks)
  - test workflows by pushing to dev and main
  - set up DigitalOcean deployment when ready (placeholder ready in workflow)
